# Image Recognition Project

This project demonstrates image recognition using a pre-trained deep learning model (Keras/TensorFlow) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It allows you to recognize objects in images either from local files or URLs.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image_recognition_project.git
cd image_recognition_project
```

2. Download the pre-trained model (`my_model.keras`) and place it in the `models/` directory.

3. Optionally, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Recognize an Image from URL

```bash
python image_recognition.py --url <image_url>
```

Replace `<image_url>` with the URL of the image you want to recognize.

### Recognize Images from Local Files (CIFAR-10 Test Images)

To recognize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset:

```bash
python image_recognition.py
```

This will predict classes for a few test images from the CIFAR-10 dataset stored locally.

## Notes

- The project uses a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Ensure that images are in RGB format for correct processing.
- If using URLs, ensure the images are accessible and valid.
